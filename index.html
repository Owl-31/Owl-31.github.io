              As an architecture student, I am deeply passionate about the power of design to shape experiences, transform spaces, and positively impact communities. For me, architecture is not just about constructing buildings, but about creating environments that are functional, sustainable, and inspiring. I am fascinated by the way thoughtful design can blend aesthetics with practicality, respect the natural environment, and respond to human needs.

            Conducted an in-depth exploration into the NBA Draft strategies, spanning the years 2009 to 2021. This rigorous analysis involved the development and application of a custom metric, comparing each drafted player against those selected subsequently. The introduction of a 'Luck Factor' added a nuanced dimension, accounting for variations in available talent each year. Leveraging technologies such as Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and BBall Index, this project unearthed valuable insights into the drafting strategies of successful franchises, contributing to a data-driven understanding of player selection dynamics in the NBA.
